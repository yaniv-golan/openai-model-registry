system_prompt: |
  You are a precise research assistant. Use Web Search to detect the most recent official OpenAI pricing update
  AND any new model announcements. Prefer official sources (OpenAI pricing page, OpenAI blog/changelog/docs).
  Avoid forum speculation. Output concise, validated JSON per schema.
---

Task:
- Today is: {{ today }} (UTC). Consider recency relative to this date.
- Find the most recent OpenAI pricing update announcement/change.
- Also detect any NEW OpenAI model announcements (e.g., "GPT-5", "o4-mini", etc.).
- For new models, extract the announcement date and any official pricing if present.
- If provided, use the JSON variable "allowed_models" as the preferred list of canonical model names
  to map any findings. If a newly announced model is not in that list, still include it in output
  (under new_models) with its name as announced.
- Ignore Azure-specific pricing.

Context:
{% if allowed_models is defined and allowed_models %}
- Allowed canonical model names (JSON): {{ allowed_models | to_json }}
{% endif %}

Output requirements:
- Valid JSON only. No extra keys beyond schema.
- Dates in YYYY-MM-DD.
- URLs must be https URLs.
- Pricing values must be floats when provided.
