abstract: >-
  A typed Python library and CLI for programmatic model cards,
  parameter validation, and capabilities/pricing metadata for OpenAI models
  (with Azure support). Includes inline parameter constraints, provider
  overrides, web-search billing (dataclass), unified pricing (with per-image
  tiers), input/output modalities, and a rich `omr` CLI for listing, querying,
  filtering, and debugging registry data. Pricing is kept up-to-date
  automatically via CI using the `ostruct` tool. Suitable for both application
  code and CI/CD use.
